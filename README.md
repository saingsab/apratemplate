TLTD
Creating new project will take more time into configure the basic need of package/crate. In order to save time I create a template wich is ready for production deployment. This template accompany with following feature: 

- [x] Actix-web with actix_rt.
- [ ] tests/health_check.
- [ ] Database Crate (sqlx).
- [ ] Compile-time Safety.
- [ ] Database Migrations.
- [ ] Logging Crate.
- [ ] Tracing's Span.
- [ ] Production Deployment Guide.
- [x] Travis CI audit package.
- [x] Docker Compose Stack.
